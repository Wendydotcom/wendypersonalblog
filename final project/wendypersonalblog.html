    <h1 id="home">Welcome to my personal blog page!</h1>
    <p>Sometimes we run into sites that are not very accessible or understandable. My personal goal is to create a website that can be intuitive, accessible to everyone, with creative design and inspiring images. You're welcome to my page, hope you're going to appreciate my work!</p>

    <p>I just told you what my main goal is... but I completely forgot to tell you who I am! <br>
        <strong>Meet me</strong>: I’m Wendy. I'm 25, I'm italian and I live 50 km away from Turin, one of the main cities in northen Italy! <br> 
        I studied web design online and self-taught during my first pregnancy because I felt unstimulated and had no job. I really want to make this passion an opportunity! <br>
        I love cooking, reading, writing and being a mom. I’m not a very sporty person but I put my heart in what I believe!

    <h3 id="myfavouriteyoutubechannel">My favourite YouTube channel</h3>
    <p>I'd really like to talk about my favourite YouTube channel, because I think it really needs to have as many followers as possible. It's a crime themed channel, an italian girl called <em>Elisa True Crime</em> talks about the most important true crime cases in the world. I appreciate the effort and passion she demonstrates in her videos. Hope you're going to love her too!</p>
